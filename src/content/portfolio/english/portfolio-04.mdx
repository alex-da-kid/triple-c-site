## Problem

Vow Vistos was struggling to generate consistent leads and revenue despite offering a valuable service in a high-demand market. The US tourist visa application process is complex and intimidating for many Brazilians, but the company wasn't effectively reaching their target audience.

**Key Challenges:**
- Low brand awareness in a competitive market
- Monthly revenue stuck at R$18,000 with no growth
- Limited digital marketing presence
- High customer acquisition costs
- Difficulty scaling beyond their initial city/region
- Relying primarily on word-of-mouth and referrals

## Client Testimonial

*"I've been in the visa consultancy business for over a decade and our demand had decreased dramatically post-COVID. I had run my own marketing campaigns without success and was under the impression that there was no more demand for visa consultancy, but it turns out that my marketing efforts were misguided. Triple-C is a highly professional team that took the time to understand our business, identified where we were going wrong, and built a strategy that actually worked. Within two months, we saw our revenue increase by 67%, and by the end of the year, we had more than tripled our monthly sales. They didn't just run ads—they optimized our entire conversion process, created landing pages that actually converted, and helped us scale to multiple cities. The demand was always there; we just needed the right team to help us reach it."*
