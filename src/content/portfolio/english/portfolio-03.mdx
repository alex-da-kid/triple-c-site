## The Challenge

You Coaching LTD had built a successful reputation through 1-on-1 coaching sessions, but wanted to scale their impact and revenue by transitioning to intensive 1-3 day communication workshops.

**The Problem:**
- Needed to fill workshops with minimum 26 participants per session to be viable
- Workshop tickets priced at $1,200-$2,800 NZD (high-ticket offer requiring trust-building)
- Limited brand awareness beyond existing coaching clients
- Only 2 workshops planned per quarter meant no room for error

---

## Our Strategy

We developed a three-tier digital marketing funnel to warm up cold prospects and convert them into workshop attendees.

### The Value Ladder Approach

**Tier 1 - Free Lead Magnets:**
- Downloadable PDFs and guides on communication skills
- Free webinars and assessments
- Built email list and identified interested prospects

**Tier 2 - Low-Cost Ebooks ($27-$67 NZD):**

Created five specialized ebooks including:
- "The Confident Communicator's Handbook"
- "Mastering Difficult Conversations at Work"
- "Executive Presence: Command the Room"

These ebooks served dual purposes: establishing authority while offsetting ad costs through micro-conversions.

**Tier 3 - Premium Workshops ($1,200-$2,800 NZD):**
- 1-Day Communication Intensive
- 2-Day Advanced Masterclass
- 3-Day Executive Bootcamp

### Targeting & Retargeting

We used Meta ads to target professionals interested in communication skills, leadership training, and professional development. Based on engagement levels (ebook purchases, page visits, video views), prospects received customized retargeting ads designed to move them toward workshop registration.

We also leveraged:
- Video testimonials from past clients
- Early-bird pricing to create urgency
- Payment plan options to remove barriers
- Social proof from each successful workshop

## Key Success Factors

1. **The Value Ladder Worked:** Low-cost ebooks dramatically increased the pool of warm prospects who eventually bought workshop tickets.

2. **Behavioral Targeting Paid Off:** Prospects who purchased 2+ ebooks had a 12% conversion rate to workshops vs. 2.1% for general audience.

3. **Ebook Revenue Model:** The ebooks built authority, warmed leads, AND covered more than half of advertising costs.

4. **Early-Bird Pricing:** Created urgency that resulted in 60% of seats selling 4+ weeks before each workshop.

## Client Testimonial

*"The transition from 1-on-1 coaching to workshops felt risky, but this marketing strategy made it seamless. Not only did we sell out every workshop, but the ebook funnel brought in revenue I hadn't even projected. We've now expanded to 3 workshops per quarter in 2025 because demand is so high."*
