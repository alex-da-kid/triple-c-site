## Problem

Lite Energy Tauranga had over 10 years of industry experience and a solid reputation in Tauranga, but their digital marketing wasn't delivering results. Despite running Google Ads campaigns, they were struggling to generate quality leads at a profitable cost.

**Key Challenges:**

- **Poor Google Ads Performance:** High cost-per-click with low conversion rates
- **Generic Ad Copy:** Ads weren't specific to service types (residential, commercial, solar)
- **No Dedicated Landing Pages:** All traffic sent to homepage, causing high bounce rates
- **Weak Local Visibility:** Not showing up in "near me" searches for electrical services
- **Low-Quality Leads:** Getting price shoppers rather than serious customers
- **Wasted Ad Spend:** Budget allocated inefficiently across broad, non-converting keywords

---

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive digital marketing overhaul focusing on three key areas: Google Ads optimization, custom landing pages, and local SEO dominance.

### 1. Google Ads Restructuring

**Campaign Segmentation:**

We split the single generic campaign into targeted campaigns based on service types:
- Residential Electrical Services
- Commercial & Industrial Electrical
- Solar Installation & Eco Solutions
- Emergency Electrician Services

**Keyword Strategy:**
- Removed broad, expensive keywords that attracted price shoppers
- Focused on high-intent local keywords: "electrician Tauranga," "solar installation Tauranga," "commercial electrician near me"
- Added negative keywords to filter out unqualified traffic
- Implemented location-specific ad scheduling based on call patterns

**Ad Copy Optimization:**
- Created service-specific ad copy highlighting unique value propositions
- Added call extensions with tracked phone numbers
- Included pricing indicators to pre-qualify leads ("Free quotes," "Upfront pricing")
- Emphasized 10+ years experience and local Tauranga presence
- Used ad extensions: sitelinks, callouts, and structured snippets

### 2. Custom Landing Pages

The biggest issue was sending all ad traffic to the generic homepage. We created dedicated landing pages for each campaign:

**Residential Electrical Landing Page:**
- Headline matched ad copy for message consistency
- Showcased residential projects with before/after photos
- Clear call-to-action: "Get Your Free Quote"
- Trust signals: Years of experience, testimonials, certifications
- Mobile-optimized click-to-call button
- Simple contact form (name, phone, service needed)

**Commercial & Industrial Landing Page:**
- Targeted business owners and property managers
- Highlighted commercial project portfolio
- Emphasized reliability, compliance, and minimal downtime
- Different value proposition: "Keeping Your Business Powered"

**Solar Installation Landing Page:**
- Focused on cost savings and environmental benefits
- Solar project gallery
- ROI calculator for potential savings
- Government rebate information
- Partnership badges with solar brands

**Key Landing Page Features:**
- Fast loading times (under 2 seconds)
- Mobile-responsive design (73% of traffic was mobile)
- Multiple conversion points (phone, form, live chat)
- Service area map showing Tauranga coverage
- FAQ sections addressing common concerns
- Social proof with Google reviews embedded

**Results:** Landing pages increased conversion rates by **156%** compared to sending traffic to the homepage.

### 3. Local SEO Optimization

To capture organic traffic and "near me" searches, we implemented comprehensive local SEO:

**Google Business Profile Optimization:**
- Complete profile with all service categories
- Regular posts with project updates and seasonal offers
- Responded to all reviews (built from 12 to 87 reviews)
- Added service area coverage across Tauranga region
- Uploaded high-quality photos of completed projects

**On-Page SEO:**
- Optimized page titles and meta descriptions for local keywords
- Created location-specific service pages
- Added schema markup for local business
- Improved site speed and mobile responsiveness
- Internal linking strategy to improve crawlability

**Local Citations:**
- Listed business on NZ directories (Nocowboys, BuildersChina, LocalSearch)
- Ensured NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across all platforms
- Created content targeting "Tauranga electrician" and related terms

**Content Strategy:**
- Published blog posts answering common electrical questions
- Created service area pages for surrounding suburbs
- Developed seasonal content (winter safety checks, summer solar benefits)
